# MicahSoft Word


## History
> MicahSoft Word, a terminal-based word processor. I made this project originally when I was completing my advanced python course and I learned how to manipulate files using Python. If you want to see the original project you may visit it here: [Off-Brand MS Word](https://replit.com/@MicahGray3/Off-Brand-MS-Word).

## This Project
> In this project, I am looking to remaster MicahSoft Word. With my current intrest in C programming, I wanted to create a project to practice and demonstrate my skills. I chose my old Python project to try and replicate and possibly improve using only C.
