Welcome to MicahSoft Word! This is a solo project I made to help me understand the c programming language.
More information can be found in the readme file, in this document I will write about this program's functionality.

All of your files created by this program will be located in the folder called "mscache".
This folder will regenerate should it be deleted.
You can only interact with files inside of the mscache folder.

Compared to the original MicahSoft Word, in this version, when you create files the program will check if the
file name is taken and ask you if you want to rename them. The program will also ask if you want to try again
if it could not find the file you were looking for.

Deleting and copying files now happen in the file writting screen instead of the title screen.
You may not be able to delete a file after it was just created, simply re-run the program, its an OS issue.
The program will evaluate the contents of the file you are working on to determine if it should be opened in
write mode or append mode.
Unlike the original MicahSoft Word, this program will read the file for you as you write and in read mode.

In write mode you will have commands to modify your writing, these commands start with a slash "/" symbol
followed by the command name. Some commands accept number arguments which should be space separated after the command.

"/clear" will completely clear all content in the file, a confirmation message will give you one last chance
to reconsider.

"/undo" will remove the last line of the file, the undo command will not work on replaced lines and should only
be used to remove lines.

"/quit" will exit the writing menu.

"/replace <number>" requires a line number (colored blue for your convinience) to select a line to replace.
You will get a prompt with a red index representing the old text and a green index representing the new text.

"/shift <number>" creates an empty line above the targeted line shifting following lines downward.
You can use the /replace command to modify the shifted line.

"/remove <number>" works like the oppositee of shift, it will destroy a specified line and move following lines up.
Note that /undo will not revert the changes caused by /remove.

"/copy <number A> <number B>" copies the line at the first argument (A) into the line in the second argument (B).

"/cut <number A> <number B>" works like /copy except the line at A will be removed afterwards.

"/help" will give you a brief description of all other commands.
